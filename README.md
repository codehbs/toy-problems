# Weekly Toy Problems
Toy problems for weekly algorithms practice during hour of code, with additional algorithm documentation throughout the year

#First things first
1. Sign up for a CodeWars account using this link: www.codewars.com/r/COzjRg

2. Choose your language and pass the initial coding wall (shoot us a note or make a pull request to ask for help!)

3. Make an account and write codeHBS as your "clan"

4. Start coding! A good sandbox to test code with is http://repl.it. Come by hour of code to work on problems in person and get help if you're stuck!


#Hour of Code
We'll use hour of code each week to work on kata's and other toy problems (e.g., whiteboarding, algorithms and other more complex coding challenges that we've seen in interviews and in computer science classes)
